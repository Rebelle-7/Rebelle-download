## About Rebelle 7

Rebelle 7 pushes the boundaries of digital art realism by mimicking **traditional painting techniques in a digital form**. Developed by Escape Motions, it’s the first software to fully integrate **fluid dynamics, pigment chemistry, and paper absorption** into an artist’s workflow.  

Each brushstroke interacts naturally with the canvas — spreading, blending, and diffusing like real paint. Artists can tilt the canvas to move liquid pigments, dry layers for detail work, and mix colors just like on a physical palette.  

The interface is clean yet powerful, offering a distraction-free workspace that supports full stylus control, multi-touch gestures, and pressure sensitivity.  

Whether you’re a fine artist or digital illustrator, Rebelle 7 delivers **true analog behavior in a digital studio** — a masterpiece of realism and control.
